Comparative Analysis of Evolutionary Programming and Evolutionary Strategies for Portfolio Optimization:

This project contains Python scripts that implement different evolutionary algorithms, including Evolutionary Programming (EP) and Evolutionary Strategies (ES), to optimize a stock portfolio based on historical stock data. The results from both algorithms are compared to identify the best-performing portfolio in terms of expected return, risk, and volatility.

Files Overview:

portfolio_optimization_ep.py: Implements the Evolutionary Programming (EP) algorithm to optimize a portfolio of stocks.

portfolio_optimization_es.py: Implements the Evolutionary Strategies (ES) algorithm to optimize a portfolio of stocks.

portfolio_optimization_advanced_ep.py: Implements an advanced version of the EP algorithm with self-adaptive mutation strategies.

portfolio_optimization_advanced_es.py: Implements an advanced version of the ES algorithm with self-adaptive mutation rates and recombination.

es_combined_selection.py: Implements the (μ + λ) version of the ES algorithm, where the next generation is selected from both parent and offspring populations.

es_offspring_selection.py: Implements the (μ, λ) version of the ES algorithm, where the next generation is selected only from offspring, introducing greater selection pressure.

portfolio_comparison.py: Compares the performance of the portfolios optimized by both EP and ES in terms of expected return, risk, and volatility.

portfolio_comparison_advanced.py: Compares the advanced versions of EP and ES.

es_selection_comparison.py: Compares the (μ + λ) ES and (μ, λ) ES versions in terms of portfolio performance.

Setup Instructions:

Prerequisites
Before running any of the scripts, ensure you have Python installed, along with the following packages:
numpy
pandas
matplotlib

You can install the dependencies with the following command:
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib

Data Requirements:
The scripts expect historical stock data and the covariance matrix to be present as CSV files in a folder. Ensure the following files are located in the specified directory:
Monthly Returns Data: Monthly_Returns_Data.csv
Covariance Matrix: Covariance_Matrix.csv

Make sure the file paths in each script match the location of your data files. You can update the data_folder variable in the scripts if necessary.
data_folder = '/path/to/your/data/'

How to Run the Scripts:

Running Evolutionary Programming (EP)
To run the Evolutionary Programming (EP) algorithm for portfolio optimization, execute the portfolio_optimization_ep.py script: python portfolio_optimization_ep.py
The script will:
Load the stock data.
Run the EP algorithm over multiple generations.
Print the best portfolio's expected return, risk (variance), and volatility (standard deviation).
Plot the fitness evolution (best portfolio return) over the generations.


Running Evolutionary Strategies (ES)
To run the Evolutionary Strategies (ES) algorithm for portfolio optimization, execute the portfolio_optimization_es.py 
script: python portfolio_optimization_es.py
This script works similarly to the EP script but uses the ES algorithm for optimization. It also prints and plots the results.

Running Advanced EP and ES
For more complex portfolio optimization, run the advanced versions:
Scripts:
portfolio_optimization_advanced_ep.py for Advanced EP.
portfolio_optimization_advanced_es.py for Advanced ES.
These versions include self-adaptive mutation strategies and advanced selection mechanisms.

Comparing the diffrent EP and ES versions
To compare the performance of the portfolios generated by the EP and ES algorithms, run the portfolio_full_comparison.py script
This script will:
Print the expected return, risk, and volatility of the portfolios optimized by the diffrent algorithms.
Plot the evolution of fitness (expected return) for all algorithms over the generations, allowing a visual comparison of how each algorithm performed.



Interpreting Results:
Expected Return: The higher, the better. It shows the average return of the portfolio over time.
Risk (Variance): The lower, the better. It indicates how much the portfolio's return can vary.
Volatility (Standard Deviation): The lower, the better. It represents the risk or uncertainty in the portfolio's return.
The comparison between EP and ES, and between different versions of ES, will help determine which algorithm performs better in balancing risk and return.

Customizing Parameters
You can adjust the following parameters in both the EP and ES scripts:

Population Size: The number of portfolios in each generation.
Number of Generations: The number of iterations the algorithm will run.
Mutation Rate: The probability and magnitude of mutations during the algorithm.
population_size = 100  # Number of portfolios in the population
num_generations = 500  # Number of generations to run the algorithm
mutation_rate = 0.01   # Probability of mutation
